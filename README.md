# Full Stack Todo App with Authentication

This is a **Full Stack Todo App** built with **Node.JS and EJS** for the server-side rendering. It includes **user authentication** (login, registration) and is designed to manage tasks efficiently. This is my **first full-stack project** and serves as a learning tool to understand and to improve my concepts in backend, and database management.

**Note: The app is currently in beta**, and improvements and bug fixes are ongoing.
